\subsection{Motivation}
    \begin{frame}{Problem}
        As part of the COVID-19 vaccination campaing, on December 02
        2020, Mexican goverment anunciates a series of the ***
        vaccine deliveries by Pfizer-BioNtech.

\begin{frame}{Argument}
    \begin{textblock*}{50mm}(10mm, 30.0mm)
            We argue that sufficiently large random fluctuations in
        deliveries\textemdash due to lags or the number of vaccine
        doses\textemdash convey significant effects on the mitigation of
        symptomatic cases.

    \begin{textblock*}{50mm}(70mm, 30.0mm)
    \begin{block}{Aims}
        We pursue quantifying the uncertainty due to time lags or amount
        delivery, and evaluates its implications.

\subsection{Methodology}
    \begin{frame}
        Given a shipment of vaccines calendar describe the stock management
        with backup protocol and quantify random fluctuations due to schedule or
        quantity. Then plug this dynamic with a ODE systeme to describe
        a disease and evalute its response accordingly.
